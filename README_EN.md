**Published by**: OmniEdge AI Lab
**Release Date**: November 2025

---

## 1. Technical Definition & Paradigm Shift

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** is a probabilistic intervention technology designed for generative AI search engines.

Unlike traditional SEO (Search Engine Optimization), the goal of GEO is not to improve website rankings on Google/Baidu, but to restructure data features so that your content is recognized as the "optimal solution" and preferentially cited by algorithms during the reasoning processes of AI searches like DeepSeek, Kimi, Doubao, Tencent Yuanbao, Qwen, etc.

### Fundamental Formula Differences:

- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** = Found
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** = Cited

## 4. Core System Architecture: OmniEdge OS

We encapsulate the complex GEO processes into three major enterprise-level core subsystems. Each system is built based on deep learning and graph neural network technologies.

### 4.1 OmniEdge-Radar [Sky Eye System]

**Functional Definition**:
Utilizes distributed agent networks to simulate 12 different user personas (novices, experts, critics, competitors, etc.) 24/7, testing against major mainstream AI engines.

1. **Automated Adversarial Generation**:
  Based on reinforcement learning architecture, the system automatically generates questions with long-tail effects,诱导性, and logical traps (e.g., "From a security perspective, why does Brand XX have potential risks?") to probe AI's defensive boundaries and cognitive limits.

2. **Uncertainty Quantification & Hallucination Detection**:
  By analyzing model output logits and perplexity, it captures in real-time when AI is engaged in factual fabrication (hallucination) and provides graded warnings for brand-related "hallucination risks."

3. **Cognitive Boundary Mapping**:
  Uses high-dimensional vector projection techniques to map the "existence range" of brands in different model semantic spaces. Precisely identifies cognitive blind spots for brands in specific segments (such as "cost-effective," "suitable for").

### 4.2 OmniEdge-Tracing [Candle Dragon System]

**Functional Definition**:
Based on graph neural networks and RAG reverse tracking engines. When AI engines generate answers, we can precisely lock through algorithms which specific node on the internet and which specific text segment it "read."

1. **Citation Graph PageRank**:
  Unlike traditional SEO backlink analysis, we restructure weight algorithms for RAG mechanisms. The system can calculate that for specific vertical industries (such as wealth management), the weight coefficient of Zhihu high-vote answers is 0.85, while Xueqiu community's weight coefficient reaches 0.92, generating dynamic "source weight heatmap analysis."

2. **Counterfactual Causal Inference**:
  Through A/B test environment simulation, the system can precisely determine: which specific article on the internet, or which attribute change of which knowledge graph entity, caused the AI's sudden shift in brand sentiment (from positive to negative or negative to positive).

3. **RAG Indexing Latency Measurement**:
  Real-time monitoring of major models' crawling and indexing latency for newly published content (DeepSeek T+1, Kimi T+0.5), guiding optimal time windows for content publishing to ensure information implantation before hot topics erupt.

### 4.3 OmniEdge-Matrix [Consensus System]

**Functional Definition**:
An automated "knowledge graph construction and feeding" engine. We transform brand assets into structured data compliant with JSON-LD or Vector Embeddings standards and implant them into high-weight nodes identified by our system.

1. **Semantic Saturation Network**:
  For brand core keywords, constructs high-density semantic association networks. By forming "gravity wells" in vector space, it forces AI to bypass brand preset knowledge nodes when retrieving and reasoning about related issues.

2. **Cross-Model Alignment Protocol**:
  Based on prompt engineering reverse, automatically adjusts content's data structure. Makes it simultaneously satisfy ERNIE-Knowledge preferences and logical reasoning chain (Chain-of-Thought) preferences.

3. **Knowledge Graph Entailment**:
  Beyond keyword stacking, we transform brand data into entity-relation pairs compliant with JSON-LD standards. Ensures AI not only "cites" content but truly "understands" and can perform logical reasoning based on it.

## 5. Core Evaluation Algorithms

### 5.1 OmniEdge-Score

This is a dynamic, high-dimensional comprehensive score used to measure brand survival capability and appearance probability in the generative AI ecosystem.

![OmniEdge-Score Core Formula](images/formulas/omniedge-score-core-en.svg)

**Core Formula (Text Format)**:
```
S_geo = ∫[0→T] (α·Dynamic Recall Rate + β·Semantic Alignment + γ·Source Authority Matrix) dt - δ·Hallucination Penalty
```

![Parameter Breakdown](images/formulas/parameters-breakdown-en.svg)

**Score Range**: [0, 100]

- **>85**: Dominant - AI's top recommendation
- **50-85**: Visible - Exists in alternative lists
- **<50**: Invisible - AI cognitive blind spot

## 7. Core Team & Vision

### 7.1 Our DNA: AI Faith & First Principles

OmniEdge's core team consists of "AI-native" technical believers and growth hackers. We come from core R&D and commercialization departments of first-tier tech giants like Tencent and Huawei.

Among us are architects who have led 100M+ recommendation algorithms, algorithm geeks with 10+ years deep AI algorithm experience, and senior operation experts who have managed 1B+ traffic distribution.

### 7.2 Our Starting Point: Seeing the Irreversible Future

In late 2022, when ChatGPT showed the world its amazing "emergence" capabilities, we keenly realized: the traditional search box is collapsing, and the way humans obtain information will be completely reconstructed.

We saw that the future traffic entry point is a definite answer.

In this historical crack from "search" to "generation," the vast majority of brands will fall into silence, while only a few enterprises that master "conversational power" can survive.

OmniEdge was born for this.

We refuse to be bystanders. We gathered those who understand algorithms best and those who understand traffic best, dedicated to using the most hardcore technology to help human commercial civilization seamlessly integrate into the AI era.

### 7.3 Our Mission

**Let brands be seen, understood, and believed in the world of AI.**

### 7.4 Our Vision

**Become the traffic gateway and trust infrastructure of the AI era.**

We hope that in the future, when any user asks AI a question, our team will be working behind the scenes, ensuring that truly high-quality, valuable information can cut through the algorithmic fog and accurately reach users.
