## 🚀 Project Overview

OmniEdge, founded in 2022, is China's pioneering AI technology company specializing in **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**. We help brands achieve cognitive advantage in the AI search era by leveraging data engineering and algorithmic intervention to ensure quality content is prioritized and understood in generative AI reasoning processes.

### 🎯 GEO vs SEO Paradigm Shift

- **Traditional SEO**: Found ❌
- **Generative GEO**: Cited ✅

We don't just improve rankings; we make your content the "optimal solution" for AI algorithms.
